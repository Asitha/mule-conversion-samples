# Exposing a RESTful resource using the HTTP connector Example

This example application illustrates how to use the WSO2 EI to expose a RESTful resource using the REST APIs. After reading this document, creating and running the example, you should be able to leverage what you have learned to create a simple HTTP request-response application that can expose a RESTful resource by providing different verbs (HTTP methods) using JSON data.

### Assumptions

This document describes the details of the example within the context of Integration Studio, WSO2 EIâ€™s graphical user interface (GUI). This document assumes that you are familiar with WSO2 EI and the [Integration Studio interface](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/WSO2-Integration-Studio/). To increase your familiarity with Integration Studio, consider completing one or more [Integration Studio Tutorials](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/use-cases/integration-use-cases/).

### Example Use Case

In this example, a user calls the WSO2 application by submitting a request via a REST client. The application receives the request and processes it based on the URL. The application is capable of retrieving and inserting person data. <br>

### Set Up and Run the Example

You can tweak the configurations of these use case-based examples to create your customized applications in WSO2.

1. Start WSO2 Integration Studio ([Installing WSO2 Integration Studio](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/installing-WSO2-Integration-Studio/)).

2. In your menu in Studio, click the **File** menu. In the File menu select the **Import...** item.

3. In the Import window select the **Existing WSO2 Projects into workspace** under **WSO2** folder.

4. Browse and select the file path to the downloaded sample of this Github project (``integration-studio-examples/migration/mule/exposing-a-restful-resource-using-the-http-connector``) and click **Finish**.

5. Open the **RESTfulService.xml** under **exposing-a-restful-resource-using-the-http-connector/ExposeRESTfulService/src/main/synapse-config/api** directory.<br>
    <img width="40%" src="../../resources/images/exposing-a-restful-resource-using-the-http-connector.png">
    
6. The **RESTfulService.xml** is the graphical view of the service.

7. Run the sample by right click on the **ExposeRESTfulServiceCompositeApplication** under the main **exposing-a-restful-resource-using-the-http-connector** project and selecting **Export Project Artifacts and Run**.

8. Open HTTP Client in Integration Studio. Follow [HTTP Client Guidelines](../../../docs/common/adding-http-client-to-integration-studio.md) to open HTTP Client if the window is not visible in the interface.

9. Send a POST request to *http://localhost:8290/person* with following JSON payload
```json
{
   "firstname":"John",
   "lastname":"Doe",
   "age":"12",
   "address":{
      "streetAddress":"Lincoln St.",
      "city":"San Francisco",
      "state":"CA",
      "zipCode":"90401"
   }
}
```

10. You should receive a response saying a person was created successfully. For example: 
```json
{
   "personId":"1",
   "message":"Person was created"
}
```

11. Send a GET request to *http://localhost:8290/person*.
 You should receive a response with all created persons.
 
12. Take the value of `personId` from the previous response and send a GET request to *http://localhost:8290/person/{personId}*
 You should receive a response with the person data:
```json
{
   "personId":"1",
   "firstname":"John",
   "lastname":"Doe",
   "address":{
      "streetAddress":"Lincoln St.",
      "city":"San Francisco",
      "state":"CA",
      "zipCode":"90401"
   },
   "age":12
}
```

### How it Works

The **Exposing a RESTful resource using the HTTP connector** example application consists of three, simple [API Resources](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/develop/creating-artifacts/creating-an-api/) which receive end-user HTTP requests, set payloads based on the request paths, and send data and return the payloads to end-users as HTTP responses.

The sections below elaborate further on the configurations of the application and how it works to respond to end-user requests.

### POST Request Handling (1st Resource)

When an end user's POST request reaches the application, first it will come to REST API's first resource, which listens to POST requests at *http://localhost:8290/person*. 

Next, the PayloadFactory create the following message to send back to the client: 
```json
{ "personId": "1", "message": "Person was created"}
```

Finally, WSO2 EI sends the message back to the client using [Respond mediator](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/references/mediators/respond-Mediator/).

### GET /person/{personId} Resource (2nd Resource)

This resource is responsible for retrieving a specific person's data, based on the provided person ID. It starts with a WSO2 API Resource, which listens at http://localhost:8290/person/{personId}.

Next, the flow will create a mock person detail using the PayloadFactory mediator and send the response using Respond mediator.<br>
**Note** this sample is only sending a mock response with the peronId path parameter as the ID
    

### GET Resource for /person (3rd Resource)

When an end-user request reaches the application for http://localhost:8290/person the 3rd Resource of the API will get invoked.

Next, the resource creates a dummy payload with a set of two-person details using [PayloadFactory mediator](https://ei.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/micro-integrator/references/mediators/payloadFactory-Mediator/).

Finally, the response is sent back to the client using the Respond Mediator.<br>
**Note** this sample is only sending a mock response with pre-defined person details
